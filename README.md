[URI5](http://uri5.com) is a compact set of URI-related PHP functions. It provides reliable ways to parse URIs, modify them, and get/compare their parts. It doesn't depend on any libraries or frameworks. To install, drop [uri5.php](https://github.com/ryanve/uri5/blob/master/uri5.php) into a directory and use [`require_once()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php) or [`include_once()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.include-once.php) to load it.
